Part 1 
cd stands for "change directory". After cd, the user puts in which file he wants to go into. For example, cd Desktop will change the directory from the current one to another directory. This can only work going forward, you cannot be in a folder in the desktop and try to change the directory to the actual desktop, you will need to go back using "../"
