Github is an easy and clear way for developers to work together on pieces of code to form a product. With github, developers are able to branch off the repository and work on new code without messing with the original working product. *Git* tracks the changes of source code during the development process. This is important since all developers want to be aware of what changes occured by other developers, creating a clear communication between developers without them really having to speak to one another. *Docker* is an opensource that delivers software in containers. *Automated testing* is responsible for executing the commits, basically testing them to see if they work with the file. Essentially, it's a piece of software that tests other software to see if that software is playing nice with the other code. *Continious Integration* is the process of merging all of the branches several times a day to detect problems in the code early on so that when the code is towards it's finished product, developers don't have to waste time and look through each code to see where the problem lies. These aspects of github improbes productivity of a company since developers can constantly test if there code works with other developers code right then and there instead of waiting for the semi-finished product. Comapnies also gain a competitive advantage since developers are finding mistakes earlier rather than later, as well as on the same page everyday before the deadline. 
 
The **vi** aspect of unix is able to read commands. Vi is referred to as a screen editor. To use vi, simply input vi (file name) this will open up the file and you will be able to begin doing commits. 

**cd** stands for "change directory". After cd, the user puts in which file he wants to go into. For example, cd Desktop will change the directory from the current one to another directory. This can only work going forward, you cannot be in a folder in the desktop and try to change the directory to the actual desktop, you will need to go back using "../"

**mkdir** stands for "make directory". This is used to create new folders in the unix code without having to go into the GUI and create a folder manually. Essentially, instead of taking a few click to make a folder in the GUI, we just write "mkdir (foldername)" and a folder will appear in that directory.

**cp** stands for "copy". This command is used to copy files, groups of files, or directories. This requires you to have to directories, one where the computer is copying the directory, and the other to tell the computer where it is being copied to. To enable, do cp (file location you want to copy) (directory where you want to copy file to)

**pwd** stands for "print work directory". This will print the current directory that the user is in at the moment. Simply type in "pwd" into unix and the directory you are in will appear. 

**v** stands for "move". It will move one or more files, or a whole directory to another place of choice. Simply type in mv (file name you want to move) (directory you want to move the file to)

**rm** stands for "remote". This is used to delete files from the directory. Once deleted, you can not recover these files. To use the function type in rm (file name). 

**history** is used to show you the previous commands you made in terminal. You can scroll through the history using the up and down arrow keys. 

The **Home directory** is the repository for the the user's personal files. After logging into the system, this is usually where the user is. To see, easily just open command prompt or terminal and you will be right there. The tilde or **~** is used to denote a user's home directoy. To operate, use ~/(file name).

**File paths in linux** is the human readable representation of a file or folder's location on the computer. We use these to find files and add data into them or remove data out of them. 

Using the **tab key** in cmd is convenient for completing file paths. If you know what the file starts with, you can type the first letter and then click tab to scroll through all the files that begin with that name. If you have no idea what's in that file, you can just keep clicking tab and it can show you the files in that directory. 

**The up and down arrow keys** are used to circle through previous functions you typed into the cmd. This is convenient because you don't have to constantly keep typing the same command over and over again, instead you can circle throguh the commands and save time and errors. This is also a good tool to see where you went wrong when typing in a command. Simply use the arrow keys to show previously typed commands.

**GitGlow** - Git-flow is a branching model and release management strategy for Git. It defines a well-formulated path for a projectâ€™s development life cycle and ensures that the development team adheres to the processes. It offers a set of extensions over Git to provide a high-level repository operation. The framework of git-flow provides visibility to the developers for planning the workspacescoped milestone and deliverable. It also helps the developers and the management to keep track of all the features, manage release flow and deal with parallel hot-fixes with its strictly typed branching conventions. You can find more about

**Repository** - Generically refers to a central place where data is stored and maintained. A repository can be a place where multiple databases or files are located for distribution over a network, or a repository can be a location that is directly accessible to the user without having to travel across a network. In many case, Respository is a a database of information about the software, including data elements, processes, inputs, outputs and interrelationships.

**Clone** -  When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.

**Fork** - A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

**Branch** - A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches.

**Commit** - A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).

**Merge** - Merge all of the commits into the base branch by clicking Merge pull request.

**Checkout** - checkout is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The git checkout command operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches. In addition to the definition of "checkout" the phrase "checking out" is commonly used to imply the act of executing the git checkout command.

**Push** - Push command pushes the commits to remote repository.
